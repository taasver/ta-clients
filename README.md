# Clients service

### Installation:
* make sure you have **node** and **npm** installed
* run `npm install` in `ta-clients` folder
* run `npm install` in `ta-clients/backend/clients-service` folder
* run `npm install` in `ta-clients/frontend` folder

### Development environment:
* run `npm start` (from `ta-clients` folder) - starts development server
* open http://localhost:8080 (if not automatically opened)

### Backend
NB! since I'm applying for frontend position the backend might not be perfect.
* backend tech: Node.js, Express, Mongodb

### Frontend
* frontend tech: Angular, Typescript, Webpack, SCSS

### Further improvements (will not be done in the scope of this test)
* delete client possibility
* validate email and other fields
* there is no phone and/or email uniqueness check


TODO:
* comment about only frontend filtering
* run both backend and frontend from root folder

* do not search from phone numbers

* frontend client comp spec
* recheck frontend (cleanup etc)
* backend tests
* refactor ObjectId
* refactor backend structure!?
* recheck backend (cleanup etc)
